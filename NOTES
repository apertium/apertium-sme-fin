       + Began processing CG, testing it out and syncing it with omorfi

Week 2 (31.-06.6.) Converting Karlsson’s CG tag set to the Omorfi tag set
       + Continued work on CG/omorfi tagset
       + Learning with apertium and doing a little lexicon expansion for random tested sentences
       - Karlsson's grammar did not include syntactic rules, a basic set of those is still necessary
